# Endless Tic-Tac-Toe Privacy Policy
Last updated: 2025-11-26

This policy explains how Endless Tic-Tac-Toe handles data inside the app.

## Information Stored on the Device
- Language, theme, vibration, and sound preferences are saved locally on your device.
- Purchase information for the ad-removal product is cached so you do not need to buy it again.
- Gameplay history or personally identifiable information is never transmitted outside the device.

## Advertising and Analytics
- Banners on the home/game screens and the interstitial that appears after wins use Google Mobile Ads (AdMob). AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the advertising ID), approximate location, and interaction logs in line with Google policies.
- Information about other devices is not collected or sent anywhere.

## In-App Purchases
- Purchases are handled entirely by Apple’s App Store. The app cannot access your payment method and only checks the minimal receipt Apple provides.
- When you restore purchases, the same receipt information is requested from Apple again.

## Use of Device Features
- When vibration feedback is enabled, the app triggers the device’s haptics.
- Sound effects only play through the speakers. The microphone is never used.

## Contact
If you have privacy-related questions or requests, please reach out via the support link listed on the store page.
